​
![](readmeAssets/tetrisDemo.gif)

## :rocket: Overview
​
This was my first project at General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. This was a project created from vanilla JavaScript and it was the first project I had created and deployed. I chose Tetris as it was a game I loved playing as a child. I also wanted to develop a game which had challenging game logic. 

Tetris is a tile matching videogame made in 1984 by Alexey Pajitov, a Russian software engineer. The aim of the game is to clear as many full rows from a grid as possible by randomly selected falling tetrominos. As the player increases the score, the speed of the falling tetromino increases therefore making the game gradually harder. 

## Timeframe
7 days

## Technologies Used
* HTML5

## Technical Requirements
* The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board
* The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about its own axis
* If a line is completed it should be removed and the pieces above should take its place
* Speed increases over time
* Persistent leaderboard using `localStorage`
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
