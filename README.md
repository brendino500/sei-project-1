## Overview
​
This was my first project at General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. This was a project created from vanilla JavaScript and it was the first project I had created and deployed.

Tetris is a tile matching videogame made in 1984 by Alexey Pajitov, a Russian software engineer. The aim of the game is to clear as many full rows from a grid as possible by randomly selected falling tetrominos. As the player increases the score, the speed of the falling tetromino increases therefore making the game gradually harder.
